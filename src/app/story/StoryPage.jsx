        <h1>Our Story</h1>
        <p>
          Eshet Digital was founded by two entrepreneurs from completely
          different industries â€“ permanent makeup and civil engineering. As
          small business owners, we experienced the same challenges our clients
          face every day: standing out in a crowded market, attracting the right
          audience, and growing beyond the basics.

          <h2>ðŸš€ The Turning Point</h2>
          <p>
            Like many businesses starting out, we tried working with marketers
            and launched simple websites. But deep down, we always wanted more.
            We wanted tools that not only looked good but truly helped us grow.
            That desire pushed us to dive deeperâ€”learning technology, branding,
            design, and strategy from the inside out.

            Because weâ€™ve been in our clientsâ€™ position, we know exactly what it
            feels like to struggle with visibility, budgets, and growth. Thereâ€™s
            no better way to connect with business owners than to share the same
            journeyâ€”and thatâ€™s what makes our approach unique.
